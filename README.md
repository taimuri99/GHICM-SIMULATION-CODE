#### Aziz Guergachi - Javed Hakim | GHICM Model Simulations

This article has one single purpose: introduce a new and simple, yet highly insightful approach to capture, fully and quantitatively, the dynamics of the circular flow of income in economies. The proposed approach relies mostly on basic linear algebraic concepts and has deep implications for the disciplines of economics, physics and econophysics.

## 📖 Overview  
This project explores how **income circulation** and **societal cohesion** influence the redistribution of wealth across economic classes within a closed economy. By modeling agent interactions over multiple business cycles, we aim to uncover how economic behaviour emerges from the interplay of inequality, connectivity, and cooperative structures.  

The research builds on an **innovative linear algebraic framework** that tracks the flow of wealth, income, and savings through interconnected agents, firms, and institutions. Using simulation-based experiments, the project demonstrates how social and economic cohesion can accelerate the redistribution of wealth, ultimately benefiting both privileged and underprivileged classes.

## 🔑 Key Contributions  
- **Novel Methodology:** A linear algebra–based framework to analyze wealth circulation in closed economies.  
- **Agent-Based Simulation:** Models wealth, income, and saving behaviour across socioeconomic hierarchies.  
- **Societal Cohesion Factor:** Captures the role of social connectivity and trust in improving redistribution efficiency.  
- **Policy Insights:** Demonstrates how higher income circulation and cohesion support more sustainable economic recovery and development.

## 🧩 Research Motivation  
> In an era of widening inequality, the gap between the rich and poor poses critical challenges to long-term economic stability.  
This research bridges **mathematical modeling** with **social science perspectives** to better understand how systemic interactions—rather than isolated events—shape wealth redistribution outcomes.

## ⚙️ Simulation Focus  
- Tracks income and savings behaviour of heterogeneous agents.  
- Observes redistribution dynamics across multiple business cycles.  
- Examines recovery rates of wealth flow from top to bottom tiers of the economy.  

---

## 📌 Findings (in brief)  
- Stronger **income circulation** enhances stability and resilience in redistribution.  
- Higher **societal cohesion** accelerates recovery from inequality shocks.  
- Wealth redistribution benefits **both privileged and underprivileged classes** when cooperative structures are present.
