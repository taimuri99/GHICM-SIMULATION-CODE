## EXAMINING THE ROLE OF INCOME CIRCULATION AND SOCIETAL COHESIVENESS IN THE BEHAVIOUR OF WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION AMONG ECONOMIC AGENTS

Across iterations of business cycles, agent interactions can determine economic behaviour. This thesis examines the relationship between circular flow of wealth, societal cohesion and wealth redistribution between the privileged and underprivileged economic classes. In todayâ€™s society where the gap between the rich and poor is increasing and detrimentally affecting economic development, this research bridges the social scientific approach to a recently introduced mathematical framework. The foundation consists of an innovative linear algebraic methodology to understand the mechanics and evolution of agent dynamics and income flow within closed economic systems. Using simulations to mimic real world wealth, income, and saving behaviour, we show the interdependence of the flow of money across the socioeconomic hierarchy and the connectivity of agents, firms, and institutions. We also show how societal cohesiveness and income circulation positively impact the recovery rate of wealth redistribution from the top levels of the economy to the bottom, benefiting both the rich and the poor.
